349,"+91 88169 50084: Certainly! Here's a Python program that simulates an ATM machine to dispense currency notes in denominations of 10, 50, and 100 based on the customer's input:

```python
# Define the available denominations
denominations = [100, 50, 10]

# Get the amount to withdraw from the user
amount = int(input(""Enter the amount to withdraw (in multiples of 10 or 100): ""))

# Check if the amount is a multiple of 10 or 100
if amount % 10 == 0 and amount >= 10:
    # Initialize a dictionary to store the count of each denomination
    note_count = {100: 0, 50: 0, 10: 0}
    
    # Calculate and print the number of each denomination to dispense
    for denomination in denominations:
        count = amount // denomination
        note_count[denomination] = count
        amount -= count * denomination

    # Display the currency notes to dispense
    for denomination, count in note_count.items():
        if count > 0:
            print(f""{denomination} Rs notes: {count}"")
else:
    print(""Amount must be entered in multiples of 10 or 100."")
```

In this code:

1. We define the available denominations as a list `[100, 50, 10]`.

2. We get the amount to withdraw from the user, ensuring that it's a multiple of 10 or 100.

3. We initialize a dictionary `note_count` to keep track of the count of each denomination.

4. We calculate the number of each denomination to dispense and update the `note_count` dictionary accordingly.

5. Finally, we display the count of each denomination of currency notes to dispense to the customer.

Make sure to enter the amount in multiples of 10 or 100 when using this program.

Here's the code in Python:

```python
n = int(input(""Enter the total number of candles: ""))
heights = list(map(int, input(""Enter the heights of the candles: "").split()))

max_height = max(heights)
count = heights.count(max_height)

print(count)
```

You can input the total number of candles and their heights, and the program will calculate and display the number of candles your niece can successfully blow out. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
